      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <div class="project">
        <p>I built a no-code platform where politicians in the US can create and manage their own campaign websites without needing technical knowledge. The websites are fully dynamic, allowing users to select components, customize layouts, and preview designs before publishing. A robust Stripe integration enables seamless monthly and yearly subscription plans. Users can publish on their own domain or purchase one directly from the app, making it a comprehensive and user-friendly website builder.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <p>This mental and healthcare platform focuses on spreading wellness through yoga, meditation, and healing practices. I built features allowing users to view wellness-related content, listen to podcasts, and purchase related products. Integrated Razorpay for payment, and OAuth-based login (Google/Facebook). The system includes gamified daily quizzes, community exploration, and rewards system where users earn points and redeem them for discounts. Everything is designed to foster daily engagement and mindful living.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <p>I designed a multi-tenant NFC digital card platform where companies can onboard users and create tap-enabled digital business cards. These cards support real-time data sharing and come with customizable templates. Users can add business hours, upload documents, update social media links, and even receive inquiries via an integrated form. It also supports role-based access within organizations. The goal was to merge modern networking with enterprise-level card and identity management.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <p>I developed a mobile application for advanced car control systems, integrating features like cruise control, speed limitation, eco/sport driving modes, and more. Admins can customize plans, manage car-user relationships, and oversee NexCruise logs through a custom Django admin panel. Real-time communication is powered by WebSockets via Django Channels. I also built a separate admin portal for car dealers and set up webhooks with Zoho CRM to sync user data automatically. The app was a production upgrade from an earlier version, including full migration of previous user data.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <p>This iOS mobile app is designed for airplane and shop owners to manage services, bookings, and work orders. Shop owners configure their availability, services, and delivery modes. Plane owners can book services that span multiple days. I implemented custom pricing, rescheduling, and approval workflows. Stripe integration handles payments and manual refunds. Notifications are sent via email, push, and in-app alerts. The admin dashboard was enhanced to manage detailed financial and booking records, though the project didnâ€™t proceed beyond beta launch.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <p>This is a B2B marketplace app for the Middle East and Gulf region, where IT companies can buy and sell hardware like laptops, servers, and accessories. Each seller and buyer is a company with multiple internal users (admins, managers, etc.). Quotes created by buyers reach only relevant sellers, who can respond with offers. Detailed quote approval workflows, custom payment methods (online & offline), shipment tracking, and admin-verified user registration make this a robust e-commerce ecosystem. Sellers can also list direct offers, which buyers can quote against, forming orders upon mutual approval.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <p>This platform helps students and researchers format academic documents using LLM-powered suggestions and corrections. After login (email or social login), users upload papers which are processed via an LLM model. They can edit or regenerate the content based on feedback. A referral system rewards both referrer and referee with credits. Credit-based usage allows for flexible access, with subscription models like pay-per-use, weekly, semester-wise, or yearly. Students also receive bonus credits for milestones. The platform integrates Trustpilot for review collection and social sharing for organic growth.</p>
